## Why Wild Counts

The wild natural world is changing. Fast. Because of us. 

Yet we know very little about **how** wild nature is changing. Which species are declining? Which are increasing? How fast? Where? How are their behaviours changing? Which species are adapting to the changes? What are the **consequences** of all these changes? For all nature. For us!

Surprisingly, the places where we tend to know the least about these things are our cities, towns, and farms. The places where we live and work. There is wild all around us, making our planet tick. Making it amazing! But, for the most part, we're not taking notice.

Sure, there are some fantastic and fanatical birders out there dedicating their lives to bird watching. It’s incredible what they’re achieving with tools like eBird. But what about in **your** neighbourhood? And what about your local butterflies or beetles, mushrooms or mosses? How are **they** doing? **Who is watching your wild?**

**Wild Counts** is about paying more attention to what's changing in the wild. All of the wild. There’s all the "how", "what", and "why" here to help you to count your wild. It's also about celebrating the people who choose to count the wild. And, it explores what we can do with all the extra knowledge that comes from wild counts.

If more of us count the wild, we’ll all learn more about how nature is changing. If we take more notice, perhaps we'll all value the wild more. Together we can make the wild count!

## What is a "wild count"?

For centuries amateur and professional naturalists have been documenting the wild. Museums and herbaria are filled with the specimens they've collected, and now modern equivalents like [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) are filling fast with millions of photos and audio recordings of wild species. Almost all of these observations were made in a haphazard way, where someone found a particular species at a particular place and time, and they were interested enough in it that they chose to record it. 

We call these "casual observations" here. That's because they were not collected in a consistent way that can be used to uncover trends and patterns in species. Complex statistics can be applied to large amounts of causal observations to suggest trends and patterns. However, it's really difficult with casual observations to untangle what the species were doing from what the people were doing. For example, was a species really absent from a site in a given year or did nobody there bother to record it? 

If you really want to know what's going on in nature, what you need is **What-Why-Where-When-How-Who** counts. These counts include **what** species were looked for in a survey (whether or not they were found), **why** (the reason for the survey), **where** and **when** the species were searched for, **how** they were searched for (the search method), and **who** was looking. 

This can be as simple as "I went out for a walk alone along my usual route, on this day between these times, without any special equipment, and looked for my favourite butterfly." You're making What-Why-Where-When-How-Who counts when when you write that down each time you're out walking, as long as you do it regardless of whether or not you find any of your favourite butterfly.

It's silly to keep saying What-Why-Where-When-How-Who counts, so we call them **wild counts**. In universities they're also called ecological survey data, although only some ecological survey data are complete wild counts, and others are wild counts plus a lot of additional complexity.

Wild counts data are **vastly** more useful than casual observations for uncovering changes in nature. That's because they're comparable in space and time, and they include all the times and places where people looked for species but didn't find them. All of this makes wild counts excellent for documenting trends and patterns in nature.

As the above butterfly example shows, making wild counts is also super simple to do. Strangely, despite this, hardly anybody does it. Most naturalists are still out there, as they were centuries ago,  following their curiousity and recording whatever grabs their interest. The WildCounts website wants to change that. It wants to help all nature enthusiasts add a dash of consistency to their nature watching.

There is one group of naturalists that have been collecting wild counts data for a long time: birders. A birder is making wild counts data when they head out with the intention of recording all birds, they record exactly where the went, and when, with what visual aids (eg binoculars or spotting scope), and who they were with. Birders have been using (eBird)[https://ebird.org] to amass tens of millions of wild counts of birds. 

Why isn't everybody else? It's just as easy to do for lots of other species. Also, you don't need to be a mad skills birder to make wild counts of birds. You can just pick one bird species that you like, and that you can reliably identify, and you can just make wild counts of that.

## About the WildCounts website

The Wild Counts website has two main parts. 

In the [Docs](docs/) section (where you are now), you'll find lots of tips and instructions on how to count the wild. That includes what to do when out looking (and listening) for species, how to enter and store your wild counts data, how to share those online, and how to analyse wild counts for trends and patterns. 

In the <a href="{{ site.posts.first.url | relative_url }}">Blog</a> section, there are stories about people making wild counts, the amazing knowledge being uncovered using wild counts, and ways that this knowledge is used to make the wild count in our society.
