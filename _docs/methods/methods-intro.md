## How would you like to count?

There are many ways to count the wild. Which one suits you best depends on you and your species.

In this section, you'll find ways to count the wild while sitting indoors, while stationary outdoors, and while moving in or on a vehicle. You can type your counts or, if you've got your hands full, you can speak your counts.

You'll also learn quick methods for counting species that are easy and hard to find, and species that are easy and hard to accurately count. You can choose to include just the basics, or plenty of detail.

Decide on a method that works for you, one that meets all of the [simple principles](../wildcounts-principles/) of wild counting. Then, get into the habit of doing it, consistently and frequently. Counting the wild is easy once you start. Starting a new habit is the hardest part.

## Ways to record your wild counts

You can type (or write) your counts using the quick **WildCounts shorthand**, or, if your hands are busy, you can speak your counts using the **WildCounts vocab**. These are the quickest, least intrusive, ways of making many counts while out and about.

### Type your counts with **WildCounts shorthand**

Do you see two monarch butterflies flying? Save time by writing `m 2f`.

[Complete WildCounts shorthand vocabulary](../wildcounts-shorthand-vocab/)

Got an iPhone? Enter WildCounts shorthand into [the FileMaker Go app](../wildcounts-app-FilemakerGo/).

### Speak your counts with **WildCounts vocab**

Do you see two monarch butterflies flying? Just say `two monarchs flying`.

## Levels of wild counting

You can keep things simple or go deep into detail. Which works best depends on your time and motivation, how many places you go to count the wild, and how abundant and easy to find are your core species.   

### Presence/absence

If your busy and go to lots of places, just presence/absence of one or a few core species works well.

### Simple abundance

For abundant species, simple abundance may be sufficient.

### Pacing the wild

Counting in paces works well for species that grow in clumps and where is not always easy to separate one individual from another.

### Counting the wild

Are there four blackbirds? `blkb 4` is your count. But what about if there's about 40? Then your count is `blkb ~40`.

### Distance-counting the wild

If you get serious about your counting, it's useful to count in distance bands away from you.
