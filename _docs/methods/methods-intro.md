## How would you like to count?

There are many ways to count the wild. Which one suits you best depends on you and your species.

In this section, you'll find ways to count the wild while sitting indoors, while stationary outdoors, and while moving in or on a vehicle. You can type your counts or, if you've got your hands full, you can speak your counts.

You'll also learn quick methods for counting species that are easy and hard to find, and species that are easy and hard to accurately count. You can choose to include just the basics, or plenty of detail.

Decide on a method that works for you, one that meets all of the [simple principles](../wildcounts-principles/) of wild counting. Then, get into the habit of doing it, consistently and frequently. Counting the wild is easy once you start. Starting a new habit is the hardest part.

## Ways to record your wild counts

You can type (or write) your counts using the quick **WildCounts shorthand**, or, if your hands are busy, you can speak your counts using the **WildCounts vocab**. These are the quickest, least intrusive, ways of making many counts while out and about.

### Type your counts with **WildCounts shorthand**

Do you see two monarch butterflies flying? Save time by typing `m 2f`.

[Introduction to WildCounts shorthand](../wildcounts-shorthand-intro/)

[Complete WildCounts shorthand vocabulary](../wildcounts-shorthand-vocab/)

Got an iPhone? Enter WildCounts shorthand into [the FileMaker Go app](../wildcounts-app-FilemakerGo/).

### Speak your counts with **WildCounts vocab**

Do you see two monarch butterflies flying? Just say `two monarchs flying`.

## Levels of wild counting

You can keep things simple or go deep into detail. Which works best depends on your time and motivation, how many places you go to count the wild, and how abundant and easy to find are your core species.   

### Presence/absence

If you're busy and go to lots of places at a lot of times, just noting the presence/absence of one or a few core species will still reveal nature's changes.

`gorse yes`

`ragwort no`

`cicada song yes`

(type type type...)

### Simple abundance

If your busy and some of your core species are often abundant, simple abundance can be sufficient. It's one step up in detail from presence/absence.

`gorse abundant`

`ragwort rare`

(type type type...)

### Pacing the wild

Counting your routes in 10 metre long patches (approximately 10 paces) works well for species that are not wildly abundant and grow in clumps where it is not always easy to separate one individual from another.

`ragwort rc1p` = one patch of ragwort close (within 5 m) on the right.

### Counting the wild

Are there four blackbirds? `blkb 4` is your count. But what about if there's about 40? Then your count is `blkb ~40`.

### Distance-counting the wild

If you get serious about your counting, it's useful to count in distance bands away from you. 

With distance-sampling, some clever statistical methods can estimate how many individiuals of your species you missed (e.g., because they were obscured from view and didn't make noise when you passed). All it takes to do that is the assumption that you're less likely to miss organisms that are closer to you, and you won't miss any that are right on top of you. This statistics can then estimate the likely true density of your species at your sites, including the things you missed. That makes for more powerful comparisons of wild counts data among different places, times, and observers.

`blkb ln4` = four blackbirds on the left in the near distance band (5--20 m).
