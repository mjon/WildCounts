## How would you like to count?

There are many ways to count the wild. Which one suits you best depends on you and your species.

In this section, you'll find ways to count the wild while sitting indoors, while stationary outdoors, and while moving in or on a vehicle. You can type your counts or, if you've got your hands full, you can speak your counts.

You'll also learn quick methods for counting species that are easy and hard to find, and species that are easy and hard to accurately count. You can choose to include just the basics, or plenty of detail.

The idea is to decide on a method that works for you, one that meets all of the <a href="../wildcounts-principles/">simple principles of wild counting</a>, and then you get into the habit of doing it, consistently and frequently. Counting the wild is easy once you start. Starting a new habit is the hard part.
