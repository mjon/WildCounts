# The Github Pages code for the WildCounts website

This is the Github Pages site that runs the [WildCounts website](https://www.wildcounts.org). It's a website that supports and celebrates people documenting the changes in wild nature.

WildCounts is set up based on the fantastic [Jekyll Doc Theme](https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme) (thanks [@aksakalli](https://github.com/aksakalli)!). I'm new to Github Pages and still getting the hand of Jekyll. I am maintaining a [list of modifications](https://github.com/mjon/WildCounts/blob/main/Modifications_to_Jekyll_Docs_theme.md) that I'm making to the Jekyll Doc Theme.
