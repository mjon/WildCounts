**WildCounts Spoken** is a set of standard words and phrasing for speaking wild counts into your phone as datetime-stamped geotagged audio notes. You can then transcribe them using Amazon Transcribe and convert them into formatted wild counts data. 

Details coming soon.

Here's a sneak peak, using **WildCounts Spoken** phrasing for the examples from the [introduction to WildCounts Shorthand](../wildcounts-shorthand-intro):

<table class="table table-striped table-hover ">
  <thead>
    <tr class="warning">
      <td><strong>Shorthand</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Spoken</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>bellb 1</code></td>
      <td>"<code>one bellbird</code>"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>bellb 1vsxm</code></td>
      <td>"<code>one male bellbird song then seen</code>"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>bellb mn_sw1vsxm</code></td>
      <td>"<code>one male bellbird song then seen mid near to the southwest</code>"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>bellb mn_sw1vsxmir!</code></td>
      <td>"<code>one male bellbird song then seen mid near to the southwest photo recorded different bird</code>"</td>
