title:  "Pacing the uncountables"
sub_title: "When you're on the move and your species is common or occurs in high densities, you can always count the wild in 10 metre (10 pace) patches."
excerpt: "Recording in 10-pace sections along transects, is, for me, an excellent balance between the intensity of recording everything in a few plots (quadrats) versus ad hoc collation of a site species lists. Of course, it works best when you're not trying to record every plant, but instead are recording a subset of species of interest, like woody weeds."

<div class="well">
This is one of a series of in-depth dives into the counting concepts used in WildCounts. We take a close look at <a href="../wildcounts-shorthand-vocab/#type-10-pace-section-counts"><strong>10-pace-section-counts</strong></a>, which is a way to quickly map out species that are too numerous or too dense to count individuals.

Sometimes it all gets too much. I don't mean this in a hectic modern life way (some days living in a pinball machine might be easier). I mean counting abundant and widespread wild species. For example, say that I've predetermined that I'll count all the big (&ge; 6 cm diameter) mushrooms I see along a walk. That's something I've been doing for several years. Then, I reach a big patch of hundreds of mushrooms of one species. 

I don't have time to stop and count hundreds of mushrooms! I'm going on a walk. Still, I've pre-determined that I'll count all of that species, so I have to count them. What can a dedicated counter of the wild do?

My solution to this conundrum is WildCounts' <a href="../wildcounts-shorthand-vocab/#type-10-pace-section-counts"><strong>10-pace-section-counts</strong></a>. I don't count every individual mushroom I see. Instead, I record everywhere I see each species in 10-pace (approximately 10 m) sections, optionally restricted to within 5 m either side of my route (the [WildCounts "close" distance](../wildcounts-shorthand-vocab/#type-geotagged-distance-band)).

I use `p` in WildCounts shorthand for 10-pace sections.  For example, one 10-pace patch (`1p`) of fly agaric ([*Amanita muscaria*](https://inaturalist.nz/taxa/48715-Amanita-muscaria)) within 5 m (`c` for close) on the left (`l`) would be entered like this:

`Amanita muscaria lc1p`

Ta dah!

If I later saw it in three consecutive patches on the right, I'd enter that observation like this:

`Amanita muscaria rc3p`

Two consecutive patches on the left with (`*`) one patch on the right would be entered like this:

`Amanita muscaria lc2p*rc1p`

When I note any of these patches on my iPhone, it geotags their locations. It's as easy as that.

This method lets me keep on walking while still documenting, in a consistent way, the abundance of each big mushroom species along my walk, including where each patch was found. Below is an example of where I've found *Amanita muscaria* along my city to hills run transect in Otautahi Christchurch, New Zealand. I recorded these using the WildCounts 10-pace section method.

  <figcaption>Here are the patches of the distinctive northern hemisphere native mushroom, <em>Amanita muscaria</em>, along my monthly city and hill runs in Otautahi Christchurch, New Zealand. That's a 28.8 km transect which I survey each month, done in two halves. Most of the <em>Amanita muscaria</em> are on the Christchurch hills, in the pine plantations and mixed oak and native tree plantings of Victoria Park, as well as associated with some northern hemisphere deciduous trees in suburban parks. Notably there is none in the wild native forest of Sugarloaf Scenic Reserve, at the southern end of the route. Displayed here are data from 24 city runs and 41 hill runs, made between 2016 and 2020. (Most of my counts from these routes are spoken audio notes still awaiting transcription.)</figcaption>

I’ve found that this method works really well. It's simple and quick to use when I'm walking,  running, and biking, and I've also used it while a passenger in a car. I've been using it for many years to count much more than just big mushrooms. I also use the method to record the distribution and abundance of invasive weeds (I have a different selection of weed species that I map out each month). I also use it for an assortment of plants like [senecios](https://inaturalist.nz/observations?locale=en&place_id=6803&preferred_place_id=6803&taxon_id=53207&view=species), [nettles](https://inaturalist.nz/observations?locale=en&place_id=6803&preferred_place_id=6803&taxon_id=51886&view=species), [muehlenbeckias](https://inaturalist.nz/observations?locale=en&place_id=6803&preferred_place_id=6803&taxon_id=72245&view=species), and [brassicas](https://inaturalist.nz/observations?locale=en&place_id=6803&preferred_place_id=6803&taxon_id=53113&view=species). Those are all host plants for the moths and butterflies I also count.

For example, each month I run a 28.8 km transect (in two parts) from the middle of Christchurch city, New Zealand, across the suburbs and up into the forested hills. It's a strong gradient in land use from central city commercial through suburban residences and into planted parks then wild nature reserves. That's the route shown in the map of *Amanita muscaria* mushrooms above. Counting every individual plant of my pre-determined species would be difficult and slow. In contrast, counting in 10-pace patches is straightforward and practical. With this method, I can map these species along the entire route, and repeat that monthly to show change over time.

The graphs below show the patterns I've found in four species of <em>Senecio</em>. These are all small, fast growing herbaceous plants, and are not widespread but can grow in dense patches. Counting every individual would be slow and tedious, but mapping them out in 10-pace patches is quite easy (once I'd got my eye in for spotting them).

These examples show a strong pattern of native species dominating in the Christchurch hills, and naturalised exotic species dominating in the built city. That's with the exception of some native species, like <em>Senecio minimus</em> above, that moved into some of the open wild gravel areas of the centre city of Christchurch following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake">the earthquakes</a> and subsequent building demolitions.

Mapping out stationary species, like plants and fungi, in 10-pace patches, is easy to do when species are easy to recognise. A lot of species are easy to recognise with a little practice. This means that wild counts can map these species over long transects, which means that a lot of data can be gathered to document their habitat preferences. That's especially helpful for uncommon species that are only occasionally encountered. 

Since it's easy to do, this can be repeated as frequently as is appropriate for the species. That can document seasonal as well as long-term changes. Long-lived perennial plants can be counted once a year, while fungi benefit from counting weekly, since they're so ephemeral. I map out senecios at least once a month, because a lot of people regard them as ugly and herbicide them or pull them out, leading to high turnover in suburban areas, plus they're wind-dispersed and fast growing and so can spread quickly.

A lot of plant ecology and vegetation science is based on data collected from infrequently revisited permanent quadrats and short transects. Those methods are necessary when the goal is to document **all** plant species at a site. However, if you're particularly interested in just a few species, there is no need to restrict yourself to meticulous surveys of just a few quadrats and short transects. 

With the  WildCounts 10-pace section method, your chosen species can be mapped out in detail over large transects, and re-mapped frequently to document seasonal and long-term changes. I see this level of large-scale, high-frequency recording, of some species, as an important and useful complement to traditional quadrat and transect data.

#### Pace yourself

So, there you have it. If your species get so dense that it's not practical to count them individually, consider counting in 10-pace sections. In our age of rapid environmental change, this makes wild counts that are repeatable in the future, by you or someone else. That's how we’ll uncover trends and understand the diversity of changes happening in nature.
