## How would you like to count?

There are many ways to count the wild. Which one suits you best depends on you and your species.

In this section, you'll find ways to count the wild while sitting indoors, while stationary outdoors, and while moving in or on a vehicle. You can type your counts or, if you've got your hands full, you can speak your counts.

You'll also learn quick methods for counting species that are easy and hard to find, and species that are easy and hard to accurately count. You can choose to include just the basics, or plenty of detail.

Decide on a method that works for you, one that meets all of the [simple principles](../wildcounts-principles/) of wild counting. Then, get into the habit of doing it, consistently and frequently. Counting the wild is easy once you start. Starting a new habit is the hardest part.

## Ways to record your wild counts

You can type (or write) your counts using the quick **WildCounts shorthand**, or, if your hands are busy, you can speak your counts using the **WildCounts spoken**. These are the quickest, least intrusive, ways of making many counts while out and about.

### Type your counts with **WildCounts shorthand**

[WildCounts shorthand](../wildcounts-shorthand-intro/) is designed so that your wild counts can be typed into your phone as quickly as possible, while still capturing all the details you need.

Do you see two monarch butterflies flying? Save time by typing `m 2f`. 

WildCounts shorthand can also get more complicated if you need it. For example, did you see five monarch caterpillars (larvae) feeding on a planted *Gomphocarpus* swan plant, close (<5 m) to your left, while you were out walking? That would be this:

`m larva lc5`<br />
`*heo`<br />
`Gophocarpus lc1$`

(The `*` means "with" and joins two observations together, while`heo` means "herbivory of" and the `$` indicates that the *Gomphocarpus* was cultivated.)

### Speak your counts with **WildCounts spoken**

Sometimes you're moving too fast to stop and type in your observations. In these cases it's faster to speak your observations using (WildCounts spoken)[].

Do you see two monarch butterflies flying? Just say "`two monarchs flying`".

Did you see five monarch caterpillars (larvae) feeding on a planted *Gomphocarpus* swan plant, close (<5 m) to your left, while you were out walking? In that case, say "`Monarch larvae left close five feeding on one Gomphocarpus left close cultivated`".

Speaking might seem like a faster thing to do all the time, but keep in mind that computers still make mistakes when transcribing human speech. That means that your spoken observations will need more time proof-reading than your typed observations.

## Levels of wild counting

You can keep things simple or go deep into detail. Which works best depends on your time and motivation, how many places you go to count the wild, and how abundant and easy to find are your core species. 

You can also mix these up in your wild counts. For example, you might count your favourite fruit-eating bird species but just note the simple abundance of the plants that it likes to feed on (and whether or not they're fruiting).

### Presence/absence

If you're busy and go to lots of places at a lot of times, just noting the presence/absence of one or a few core species will still reveal nature's changes.

`gorse yes`<br />
`ragwort no`<br />
`cicada song yes`

### Simple abundance

If you're busy and some of your core species are often abundant, simple abundance can be sufficient. It's one step up in detail from presence/absence.

`gorse abundant`<br />
`ragwort rare`

### Pacing the wild

Counting your routes in 10 metre long patches (approximately 10 paces) works well for species that are not wildly abundant and grow in clumps where it is not always easy to separate one individual from another.

`ragwort rc1p` = one patch of ragwort close (within 5 m) on the right.

### Counting the wild

Are there four blackbirds? `blkb 4` is your count. But what about if there's about 40? Then your count is `blkb ~40`.

### Distance-counting the wild

If you get serious about your counting, it's useful to count in distance bands away from you. 

With [distance-sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_sampling), some clever statistical methods can estimate how many individuals of your species you missed (e.g., because they were obscured from view and didn't make noise when you passed). All it takes to do that is the assumption that you're less likely to miss organisms that are closer to you, and you won't miss any that are right on top of you. This statistics can then estimate the likely true density of your species at your sites, including the things you missed. That makes for more powerful comparisons of wild counts data among different places, times, and observers.

`blkb ln4` = four blackbirds on the left in the near distance band (5--20 m).
