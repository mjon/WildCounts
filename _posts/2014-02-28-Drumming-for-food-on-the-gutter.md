Here's one of the natural history highlights of this years' <a href="http://www.lincolnecology.org.nz/?page_id=678">Field Ecology</a> undergraduate course at <a href="http://lincoln.ac.nz/">Lincoln University</a>. We stay at the <a href="http://www.boyle.org.nz/">Boyle River Outdoor Education Centre</a> near Lewis Pass in the Southern Alps of North Canterbury. Just outside our bedrooms, a South Island robin, kakaruwai (<a href="https://inaturalist.nz/taxa/413513-Petroica-australis-australis"><em>Petroica australis australis</em></a>) would show up most days to forage in the guttering. It would work its way along, drumming its foot to make a noise reminiscent of rain falling, and then it would dash into the guttering to retrieve invertebrates that it flushed out.

It's an interesting foraging behaviour. I must get a ladder next time I'm up there and see what happens when I drum on the guttering at a similar frequency.

I've since seen robins doing a similar same thing in leaf litter, drumming a foot and grabbing any invertebrates that they flush out.

Here's the same observation <a href="https://inaturalist.nz/observations/1186058">archived on iNaturalist NZ</a>.
