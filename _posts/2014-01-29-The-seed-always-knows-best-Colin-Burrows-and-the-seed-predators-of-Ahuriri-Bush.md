On Friday I attended the funeral of Colin Burrows. Colin was a well known, well regarded, and "formidably well informed" plant ecologist (to borrow David Galloway's apt phrase from the funeral). He was also a botanist, biogeographer, mountaineer, conservationist, historian, and poet, among other things. And a really nice guy. It's sad that's he's gone.

I had the privilege of being taught by Colin when I was an undergraduate and honours student back in the early 1990s at the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz">University of Canterbury</a>. I was amazed by the extraordinarily depth and breadth of his knowledge of New Zealand plants and vegetation. He was a man of the mountains and knew all of their botanical inhabitants. His lectures and field trips were filled with plants I'd never heard of, which made be feel quite inadequate as I scrambled to catch up. It's what I expected from university and I enjoyed the challenge.

As something of a tribute to Colin, I thought I'd use my blog post this week to revisit my first scientific paper. It involved Colin's long standing interest in seeds and my growing interest in plant-insect interactions.

At the end of my honours year of my Bachelor of Science, while I was waiting to head off to Costa Rica for my PhD, Colin organised a small paid project for me. It was to collect and help identify the insects that were eating the seeds of native woody plants in Ahuriri Valley on the Christchurch Port Hills. 

Colin had a strong interest in vegetation change (he wrote <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-3058-5_11">the text book on the subject</a>) and one of his long running study sites was the Ahuriri Valley. At the time of my research, Colin had projects running on native plant seed production, dispersal, and germination. A hole in his understanding was how many of these seeds were eaten by insects, and by which species. 

I spent much of my 1993–1994 summer up in Ahuriri Valley collecting seeds. Our aims for the project were simple: to identify the insect seed predators of many of the common native tree species in Ahuriri Valley, Christchurch Port Hills (and certain other plants of interest), and to get an indication of the percentage of seeds eaten by each predator. 

We were fortunate to have entomologist John Dugdale on our team, whose depth and breadth of knowledge of New Zealand insects was (at least) the match of Colin's plant knowledge. I collected the seeds, recorded the proportions fed on my different insects, and John, for the most part, reared them through to adulthood and figured out what they were.

We wrote up the work as a small paper for the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0028825X.1995.10412962">New Zealand Journal of Botany</a>. A colleague at <a href="http://www.landcareresearch.org.nz">Landcare Research</a> recently, and kindly, referred to it as a "great wee classic". My biggest lesson from this project, other than that I had a lot to learn, was that there was a vast amount of basic natural history in New Zealand still to be discovered. Being able to put a name on a species was only the beginning. That was about the extent of our knowledge of a great many New Zealand insects. For the most part, it still is.

There are lots of insects mounted on pins in New Zealand museums that were caught as adults, in assorted clever traps, and described for science and given names. For many, perhaps most, of these insects, we still know nothing at all about their larvae and what those eat. Furthermore, insects with larvae that specialise on eating seeds are feeding on the most well defended and usually poisonous parts of a plant. Seeds are plants' babies, after all, and parents invest a lot in keeping their offspring safe. Seed predator insects (baby plant killers!) typically only have the physiology capable of handling the defences from one species or genus of plant. Because of this, most of our native plants have their own specialist native seed predators (and most exotic weeds have no seed predators at all).
 
We concluded our paper with "it is our hope that this pilot study will encourage plant scientists and entomologists to take a greater interest in this area of plant-animal interaction in New Zealand." Since then, entomologist Nicholas Martin has produced his extraordinary <a href="http://plant-synz.landcareresearch.co.nz">Plant-SyNZ database</a> that fills many holes in our knowledge of what insects eat what plants. 

Still, here we are 20 years later and it's fair to say that our understanding of the New Zealand food web, of what species eat what species, is still rudimentary. There is still a vast amount of basic natural history in New Zealand waiting to be discovered. Thankfully, modern technology is now making this much easier (and fun!). You can now join me and lots of other New Zealanders making these discoveries on <a href="http://https://inaturalist.nz">iNaturalist NZ</a>. 

Next time you look at a native (or exotic) plant in seed, have a second look. Are there insects inside? Take some photos and load them on <a href="http://https://inaturalist.nz">iNaturalist NZ</a>. Better yet, put those seeds in a jar and see what adult insects emerge, and share photos of those adults on <a href="http://https://inaturalist.nz">iNaturalist NZ</a>. Someone probably already knows the name of the adult, but we may not yet know what their larvae eat. The paper that Colin, John, and I wrote is still just the beginning.
