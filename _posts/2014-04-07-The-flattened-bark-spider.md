While taking a lunch break at Klondyke corner, on the eastern edge of Arthur's Pass National Park, New Zealand, I started peeling bark off an old fallen tree to see what I could find (as you do--or if you don't, you should, as you can find all sorts of interesting critters). I was surprised to find a remarkably flat spider living in the narrow space between the wood and the old bark.

I'd not seen a spider like it before. Lincoln University entomologist <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike_Bowie">Mike Bowie</a> had, and helped me find the name. It's [*Hemicloea rogenhoferi*](https://inaturalist.nz/taxa/390373). This is not a native New Zealand species but an Australian species. It was accidentally brought to New Zealand and has successfully naturalised here. It's now found <a href="https://inaturalist.nz/observations?taxon_id=390373">throughout the country</a>, including some remote wild areas.

I could not find out much about this spider at all on the internet (I had to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicloea_rogenhoferi">Wikipedia page stub</a> for it). I expect it's one of the great many invertebrate species in New Zealand for which we have a name but know next to nothing about.

Since then I've noted every time I see one of these spiders during my wild counts, but I encounter them very infrequently (probably because they're so good a hiding away in cracks).
